We tilt our heads when we are curious, flirtatious or attempting to appear innocent. This is why this gesture is listed with Sq, Ye and Ip. You\'ll see Pe appear when someone is explaining a point they want to communicate very clearly in a friendly environment.\n\nThe first conflicting behaviour listed is Jc. This behaviour could indicate that the gesture was a sign of anger, aggression or a challenge. Males (and sometimes females) will expose vital parts of the body in order to appear fearless to their adversary.\n\nThe second conflicting behaviour is Tp, as the head-tilt is sometimes associated with boredom. Feigned boredom is far more likely to present with a head tilt than actual boredom is.\n\nSome research, including that of Desmond Morris, details the possible or observed differences between the leftward and rightward tilt of the head. Thus far, no significant study has been conducted to validate these observations and the direction of tilt in the BToE is irrelevant.'),(3,2,'Chin Thrust','Ct','Co,Df','Ec,Ag','Jc',2,'Ukr,AsI','1U/2M','Agg','Vh','Head',4,'D','gray','The chin thrust is a gesture that has cultural implications in the Middle East and some southern Asian countries such as the southern Ukraine and the Slavic Republic. In the exceptional regions, the chin thrust is communicated very regularly in conversation to indicate agreement and to point directions in lieu of an extended finger and arm in America.\n\nIn the BToE there are two variations. One is used as a deliberate movement while in conversation and the other is a seemingly involuntary and short-lived micro-gesture of sorts.\n\nIn the first variable, the majority to communicate anger, dissatisfaction or a challenge between competing humans uses the chin thrust. The chin thrust is usually a challenge in the USA and is so due to the deliberate exposure of the vital organs to another person.\n\nThe second variable is actually a ventilating gesture used mostly by men. This type of chin thrust is a way for men to adjust the collar of a collared shirt without having to use their hands to do so.\n\nYou\'ll notice that the sexual propensity field contains \'1U/2M\', meaning that variable 1 is universal and variable 2 is performed by mostly men.'),(4,3,'Brow Flash','Ef','Sq,Ye','Pe,hb','none',1,'Universal','Universal','Open','Jc,Tp','Eyes',1,'DNL','green','The eyebrow flash is common among almost every developed culture.

This gesture raises the eyebrows and is used to convey friendliness, trustworthiness and vulnerability.\n\nConstantly-raised eyebrows can indicate anger and fear and is used frequently to communicate an extremely important point with emphasis. Parents frequently will do this when scolding children.\n\n\nThis is divided into two separate gesture variations: 1. The Eyebrow flash: Ef1 2. The constant raised eyebrows expression: Ef2\n\nNote:\n\nWhen people see someone give them an eyebrow flash, an unconscious phenomenon takes place that causes the majority of people to return the eyebrow flash gesture unconsciously and most people aren\'t aware they have even made that expression after they\'ve done it.'),(5,4,'Downcast','Hd','De','Jc,Cs','None',1,'U-ASI','-Universal','Open','Gpr','Head',2,'DNL','blue','The downcast head has multiple meanings given contextual reference, but the majority of these gestures are used when a subject is experiencing shame, guilt, submissiveness, and personal anger.\n\nThe ~ symbol before the U in the sexual propensity field indicates that both sexes perform this action and it is sometimes used more often by women, especially during the early stages of flirtation and courtship.\n\nGpr is indicated here to show that this behaviour will display contraindications of typical downward head behaviour.

This action creates a barrier that prevents them from speaking and you\'ll see this in conversations on a daily basis. While lip compression is usually performed when someone is holding back information, it doesn\'t mean deception is likely at all. Social rules and norms, peer pressure, and societal influences cause us to hold our tongues regularly in conversation.\n\nThe only time it will be extremely significant is if you are observing a subject listening to a hypothetical re-enactment of a crime or being provided possible reasons the crime committed is an understandable and somewhat acceptable offense given the circumstances. This will sound alarms.

(Darwin, 1872) These children will also reflexively turtle their bodies in response to sudden movements by a nearby abusive parent. (Schutz, 1958)\n\nThe gesture occurs in adults when fear is present and should be contextually relevant to arouse any suspicion of deception in interview scenarios.\n\nThis is a temperature-affected behaviour and is more common in colder temperatures.'),(9,8,'Object Mouth','Om','Jc','Lr,Bn','Ip',1,'Universal','Universal','Uns','Ps','Face',2.5,'B','white','The insertion of any object into the mouth by a subject is not likely to be deceptive behaviour.

In conversation and social settings, instead of taking a giant breath, you will see the slight flaring of nostrils when this occurs. This is a way for us to increase blood oxygenation by taking in a larger volume of air. Situations that create physical or emotional arousal produce some of the same neurochemicals as stress.\n\nLikewise, you will observe wing dilation (the nonverbal term for this) in emotionally aroused subjects engaged in conversation. You\'ll see more wing dilation in attraction and arousal scenarios while a subject is listening to someone speak that they are attracted to or aroused by'),(12,11,'Confirmation Glance','Cg','Pe,Ss','Hu,Fns','Ip',1,'Universal','Universal','Uns','Jc','Face',4,'BDA','gray','During the course of an interview or conversation, subjects will tend to look at people or a group of people to confirm that a statement has been understood and sometimes to confirm they are being believed. Following a statement, a cursory glance at another party in the room to verify that their \'story\' is working on the group is called a confirmation glance.\n\nWhile this behaviour occurs before, during, and after a statement; it is more likely to occur just after a statement, answer, or denial of guilt in an interview setting. In social settings, you\'ll see confirmation glances will always tend toward the most socially influential or powerful person in the group while people are engaged in conversation.'),(13,12,'Yawn','Yn','Bu,Hu','Pt,Fc','Hu',0,'Universal','Universal','Open','Ot','Face',1,'Ht','blue','While yawning is most commonly associated with boredom and tiredness, it is a very likely sign of anxiety and sometimes deception.\n\nWhen no deception is present and no other signs of deception are observed in the current phase of the interview, the yawn is likely nothing more than a sign of boredom. Yawns that originate directly from boredom or tiredness tend to last almost twice as long as a yawn caused by anxiety.\n\nIn some cases, a false yawn is produced prior to questioning and it has not been proven yet, but guilty people almost exclusively exhibit this behaviour.

First, many people unconsciously tilt their heads backward while looking upwards to retrieve information. When in conversation and asked to recall a set of data about a remembered event, subjects will tilt their head back while attempting to retrieve information, whether it\'s true or false.\n\nTilting the head backward also exposes the vital part of our neck. Males will typically perform this movement while challenging another person physically or while preparing for a fight. Exposing vital parts of the body to an adversary in the animal kingdom shows that one has no fear of being harmed by the other.'),(17,16,'Lip Retract','Lr','Oi,Bn','None','Br',1,'Universal','Universal','Uns','Sq','Face',2,'DA','white','Lip retraction closely resembles lip compression, but the two have very different implications.

Sweating is common among the guilty and innocent, but the need to ventilate physically is far more common to appear in deceptive and high-stress subjects.\n\nUsing clothing and other objects, ventilation behaviour can appear in several forms:\n\n1. Pulling or tugging a shirt collar to force air into the shirt and allow heat to escape. (most commonly seen in male subjects)\n\n2. Pulling the front of a shirt to ventilate heat\n\n3. Moving long hair away from the back of the neck in order to allow airflow\n\n4. Adjustments wherein a subject lifts their bottom from a chair for an unusually long period.

These hand motions seem to keep time with spoken rhythm. Important things to take away from the observation of baton gestures are intensity, capillary presence and whether or not the baton gesture is in synchronous rhythm with the spoken words.\n\nAn asynchronous baton gesture can indicate a rift between what is being felt and said.

The support gesture involving the hand resting has two basic identifiable variables:\n\n1. The chin rests on the hand.\n\n2. The head is tilted to rest on a hand near the ear.\n\nThe amount of surface contact in variable 1 above can often indicate the level of boredom or the intensity of fatigue in subjects.

Watching a great movie causes blink rate to decline, and taking the\nSAT causes a marked increase in blinking. During courtship, increases in blinking can be 5\nattributed to attraction.

Babies looking at their mothers will do this. Prospective mates will show pupil dilation and even exposure to photos of baby animals can cause the pupils to dilate significantly.\n\nExposure to disgusting, repulsive, ugly or traumatic images and subjects causes pupils to constrict and, given a consistent light source, this is rather easy to spot.'),(29,28,'Squint','Sq','Ot,Hs','Lc','Br',1,'Universal','Universal','Closed','Ye,Agg','Eyes',1,'DNL','white','Squinting the eyes has so many Hollywood connotations, but they are rarely seen in real life.
