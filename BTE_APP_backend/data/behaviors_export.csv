Ga,No gestures at all
Ht,"The head tilt is an open and vulnerable gesture. We tilt our heads when we are curious, flirtatious or attempting to appear innocent. This is why this gesture is listed with Sq, Ye and Ip. You'll see Pe appear when someone is explaining a point they want to communicate very clearly in a friendly environment.

The first conflicting behaviour listed is Jc. This behaviour could indicate that the gesture was a sign of anger, aggression or a challenge. Males (and sometimes females) will expose vital parts of the body in order to appear fearless to their adversary.

The second conflicting behaviour is Tp, as the head-tilt is sometimes associated with boredom. Feigned boredom is far more likely to present with a head tilt than actual boredom is.

Some research, including that of Desmond Morris, details the possible or observed differences between the leftward and rightward tilt of the head. Thus far, no significant study has been conducted to validate these observations and the direction of tilt in the BToE is irrelevant."
Ct,"The chin thrust is a gesture that has cultural implications in the Middle East and some southern Asian countries such as the southern Ukraine and the Slavic Republic. In the exceptional regions, the chin thrust is communicated very regularly in conversation to indicate agreement and to point directions in lieu of an extended finger and arm in America.

In the BToE there are two variations. One is used as a deliberate movement while in conversation and the other is a seemingly involuntary and short-lived micro-gesture of sorts.

In the first variable, the majority to communicate anger, dissatisfaction or a challenge between competing humans uses the chin thrust. The chin thrust is usually a challenge in the USA and is so due to the deliberate exposure of the vital organs to another person.

The second variable is actually a ventilating gesture used mostly by men. This type of chin thrust is a way for men to adjust the collar of a collared shirt without having to use their hands to do so.

You'll notice that the sexual propensity field contains '1U/2M', meaning that variable 1 is universal and variable 2 is performed by mostly men."
Ef,"The eyebrow flash is common among almost every developed culture. When performing this gesture, subjects will quickly raise and lower their eyebrows, usually upon greeting another person. Anger makes the face crumple and lowers the eyebrows significantly. This gesture raises the eyebrows and is used to convey friendliness, trustworthiness and vulnerability.

Constantly-raised eyebrows can indicate anger and fear and is used frequently to communicate an extremely important point with emphasis. Parents frequently will do this when scolding children.


This is divided into two separate gesture variations: 1. The Eyebrow flash: Ef1 2. The constant raised eyebrows expression: Ef2

Note:

When people see someone give them an eyebrow flash, an unconscious phenomenon takes place that causes the majority of people to return the eyebrow flash gesture unconsciously and most people aren't aware they have even made that expression after they've done it."
Hd,"The downcast head has multiple meanings given contextual reference, but the majority of these gestures are used when a subject is experiencing shame, guilt, submissiveness, and personal anger.

The ~ symbol before the U in the sexual propensity field indicates that both sexes perform this action and it is sometimes used more often by women, especially during the early stages of flirtation and courtship.

Gpr is indicated here to show that this behaviour will display contraindications of typical downward head behaviour. This is seen regularly in abused spouses, sexually abused children, and children who are frequently bullied in school."
Lc,"There are several gestures that involve lip compression, but this expression is one that is almost universally indicative of someone suppressing opinions. This action creates a barrier that prevents them from speaking and you'll see this in conversations on a daily basis. While lip compression is usually performed when someone is holding back information, it doesn't mean deception is likely at all. Social rules and norms, peer pressure, and societal influences cause us to hold our tongues regularly in conversation.

The only time it will be extremely significant is if you are observing a subject listening to a hypothetical re-enactment of a crime or being provided possible reasons the crime committed is an understandable and somewhat acceptable offense given the circumstances. This will sound alarms. The above scenario is simply an example and should not hinder an analyst from making a judgment call on a behaviour involving Lp that seems deceptive in context."
Ts,"This behaviour is universally anti-social in conversation and thus becomes an aggressive behaviour when deliberately performed in the conversational presence of others.

Variables

1. Sucking teeth as a deliberate anti-social act

2. Sucking teeth as a hygienic gesture"
Tu,"Turtling behaviour is seen when the shoulders draw upward and the head is lowered downward simultaneously. This behaviour protects the neck and other vital organs and is a fear-based gesture. Children who have been abused will frequently display this in interviews and when approached by unknown strangers. (Darwin, 1872) These children will also reflexively turtle their bodies in response to sudden movements by a nearby abusive parent. (Schutz, 1958)

The gesture occurs in adults when fear is present and should be contextually relevant to arouse any suspicion of deception in interview scenarios.

This is a temperature-affected behaviour and is more common in colder temperatures."
Om,"The insertion of any object into the mouth by a subject is not likely to be deceptive behaviour. This behaviour is performed mostly out of a need for reassurance or due to uncertainty.

Men and women do this equally. 2 This cell also includes the biting of the lip wherein the lip actually passes into the mouth.

A simple 'lip' can be annotated in the comments section of the accompanying gesture block in the interrogator's notebook."
Jc,This nonverbal cue is seen in the jaw muscles and the temple area. It suggests a subject is withholding aggressive action or feelings most of the time and can also signify latent hostility or anger at what is being done or discussed.
Wd,"All mammals require oxygen to survive. As our hearts beat faster in response to stressors, our body sends a signal that more oxygen is required to meet the needs of the impending adrenaline rush. In conversation and social settings, instead of taking a giant breath, you will see the slight flaring of nostrils when this occurs. This is a way for us to increase blood oxygenation by taking in a larger volume of air. Situations that create physical or emotional arousal produce some of the same neurochemicals as stress.

Likewise, you will observe wing dilation (the nonverbal term for this) in emotionally aroused subjects engaged in conversation. You'll see more wing dilation in attraction and arousal scenarios while a subject is listening to someone speak that they are attracted to or aroused by"
Cg,"During the course of an interview or conversation, subjects will tend to look at people or a group of people to confirm that a statement has been understood and sometimes to confirm they are being believed. Following a statement, a cursory glance at another party in the room to verify that their 'story' is working on the group is called a confirmation glance.

While this behaviour occurs before, during, and after a statement; it is more likely to occur just after a statement, answer, or denial of guilt in an interview setting. In social settings, you'll see confirmation glances will always tend toward the most socially influential or powerful person in the group while people are engaged in conversation."
Yn,"While yawning is most commonly associated with boredom and tiredness, it is a very likely sign of anxiety and sometimes deception.

When no deception is present and no other signs of deception are observed in the current phase of the interview, the yawn is likely nothing more than a sign of boredom. Yawns that originate directly from boredom or tiredness tend to last almost twice as long as a yawn caused by anxiety.

In some cases, a false yawn is produced prior to questioning and it has not been proven yet, but guilty people almost exclusively exhibit this behaviour. (Navarro, 2011)"
Ha,"This facial expression and its associated microexpression cause the upper parts of the face to draw upward, causing wrinkling of the skin in the outer corners of the eyes and causing the eyelids to draw closer together.

A fake (or social) smile is mostly done using only the lower face and can appear to have an unequal muscular contraction on both sides of the face."
Fl,"Flushing is a natural reaction in all humans as a result of an adrenaline spike. The adrenaline produced during an embarrassing moment causes vasodilation and opens up blood vessels in order to receive more oxygen. (Darwin, 1872) (Ekman P. , Facial expression of emotion: new findings, new questions, 1992) (Vrij, 2001)

In an interview setting, the appearance of blushing may be due to embarrassment, guilt or fear. The other gestures observed within a group will tell you which meaning the subject is communicating.

Other causes of blushing or flushing to be aware of are alcohol, sexual arousal and the consumption of certain 'party drugs'."
Hb,"
Tilting the head back can have multiple nonverbal translations when the context is taken into account. First, many people unconsciously tilt their heads backward while looking upwards to retrieve information. When in conversation and asked to recall a set of data about a remembered event, subjects will tilt their head back while attempting to retrieve information, whether it's true or false.

Tilting the head backward also exposes the vital part of our neck. Males will typically perform this movement while challenging another person physically or while preparing for a fight. Exposing vital parts of the body to an adversary in the animal kingdom shows that one has no fear of being harmed by the other."
Lr,"Lip retraction closely resembles lip compression, but the two have very different implications. When the lips go into the mouth, as mentioned in Oi earlier, there is a need for reassurance or an uncertainty about what is being discussed or what the subject is being questioned about.

This occurs equally in men and women alike.
"
Ot,"This behaviour refers to the muscular tension around the human eye. When we experience things like curiosity, focus and intense conversational emotions; the muscles around the eye contract and appear to make the ocular opening smaller.

Squinting developed in humans in order to temporarily allow the eye to see things with slightly clearer focus by slightly modifying the shape of the eye and reducing the amount of light taken in by the pupils."
Bn,"The narrowing of the brow is typically associated with anger in westernized culture and is almost universally recognized as being connected to deep levels of concentration as well.

This usually presents itself before and during the question/answer phase and, depending on context, indicates an angered emotional response to the current subject or an emotionally related thought during the question phase of the interview."
Vh,"As the heat builds up in the body due to increased stress, anxiety and the adrenaline spikes commonly associated with deception and stress, subjects will perform various behaviours intended to lower body temperature. Sweating is common among the guilty and innocent, but the need to ventilate physically is far more common to appear in deceptive and high-stress subjects.

Using clothing and other objects, ventilation behaviour can appear in several forms:

1. Pulling or tugging a shirt collar to force air into the shirt and allow heat to escape. (most commonly seen in male subjects)

2. Pulling the front of a shirt to ventilate heat

3. Moving long hair away from the back of the neck in order to allow airflow

4. Adjustments wherein a subject lifts their bottom from a chair for an unusually long period. Regardless of the type of ventilation behaviour exhibited, all are intended to pacify the same need."
Aa,"The sudden rise of the Adam's apple can indicate disagreement and stress. Conflicting The gesture that conflicts with the above meaning is the facial expression of fear. The Adam's apple, in this instance, is directly associated with the Reticular Activation System, a precursor to the 'fight or flight' response."
Gg,"The guiding gesture is used when telling or showing someone where something is or where to go. When someone points to an object or direction or emits any form of nonverbal communication with the intent of guiding the gaze or direction of travel of another person is considered a guiding gesture.

1. Guiding with hands: Gg1
2. Guiding with head motion: Gg2
3. Guiding using the removal of self from path: Gg3"
Bg,"The gestures made while speaking that are used to accentuate syllabic emotional punctuation are all baton gestures. These hand motions seem to keep time with spoken rhythm. Important things to take away from the observation of baton gestures are intensity, capillary presence and whether or not the baton gesture is in synchronous rhythm with the spoken words.

An asynchronous baton gesture can indicate a rift between what is being felt and said. Subjects will very often gesticulate and express a statement that coincides with it. When there is a timing gap, the emotion is almost NEVER genuine."
Ye,"The vertical head-shaking motion we all use to indicate 'yes' in the United States and most other countries.

The conflicting gesture here is protective and barrier behaviours. These include covering the body, closing the legs and protecting the genitals."
Hs,"While this behaviour is performed by way of an arm and hand movement, the head is listed due to its body-region priority. The support gesture involving the hand resting has two basic identifiable variables:

1. The chin rests on the hand.

2. The head is tilted to rest on a hand near the ear.

The amount of surface contact in variable 1 above can often indicate the level of boredom or the intensity of fatigue in subjects. When boredom is feigned, it is far more likely to see a more upward gaze and slightly less than usual hand-to-face contact."
Sp,"The most authentic facial expressions of surprise will cause the eyebrows to rise, exposing the sclera (white part of the eye) above the iris. The lower jaw will also drop in response to genuine surprise. Even when surprise is being suppressed, a small, but noticeable drop of the lower jaw can be seen on a subject's face. It would take countless hours of training and/or practice to 4 successfully conceal surprise on the face."
Br,"When humans are captivated, interested or otherwise curious about something in their field of
view, the blink rate will slow and gradually decline as the interest piques. Conversely, an
increasing or rapid blink rate is indicative of high-stress and associated with low levels of
concentration and interest. Watching a great movie causes blink rate to decline, and taking the
SAT causes a marked increase in blinking. During courtship, increases in blinking can be 5
attributed to attraction. A rapid blinking during conversation can also be interpreted as a feeling
of superiority and contempt."
Pd,"The pupils have only one physiological function: to control the amount of light passing into the eye. However, when humans experience emotional fluctuations, the pupils can respond by signalling the emotional response to a subject, person or photograph that is present.

In response to pleasurable emotional or visual stimuli, the pupils expand and dilate. Babies looking at their mothers will do this. Prospective mates will show pupil dilation and even exposure to photos of baby animals can cause the pupils to dilate significantly.

Exposure to disgusting, repulsive, ugly or traumatic images and subjects causes pupils to constrict and, given a consistent light source, this is rather easy to spot."
Sq,"Squinting the eyes has so many Hollywood connotations, but they are rarely seen in real life. The squint is primarily a response to stress, disagreement or anxiety."
Sh,"he shoulder shrug has been documented since Darwin first wrote about it in his journal musings in the late 1800s. Today, the shrug is widely accepted for meaning one of about four things, given contextual detail:

1. Uncertainty
2. Surrender
3. Fear
4. Denial of guilt

While some books and research articles cite this behaviour as being possibly deceptive, it has been
observed by Axon as mostly fear-based. The single-sided shoulder shrug, however, is much more likely to be associated with deception in an interview scenario.8"
Sa,The sad facial expression is nothing more than a pronounced effect of gravity on the face and full relaxation of the facial and ocular muscles. The listed conflicting element here is jaw clenching (Jc) due to its likelihood to immediately precede anger or violence.
Dg,"This facial expression is seen when someone is experiencing emotional or physical disgust. If you were to imagine putting your nose into the mouth of a jug full of rotting milk, this expression will show on your face; all of the parts of the face can be seen almost drawing
towards the middle of the face.

When this facial expression is seen in social and interview settings, the subject being discussed is usually responsible for the expression. Subjects almost never feign this expression and it is highly reliable for observation.

The conflicting gesture listed here is nostril wing dilation (Wd). This nostril dilation may indicate a need for air more than disgust."
Fr,"The fearful facial expression causes the eyes to widen and exposes the sclera around the top and bottom of the iris. The lips stretch horizontally backwards and the eyebrows rise outwardly.

Conflicting gestures listed here are 'arms behind back' and 'arms in the air'

These two behaviours could indicate that the facial expression could result from pride-smiling and intense excitement"
Co,"The contempt facial expression is the only genuine facial expression that shows stronger on one side of the face. Contempt is best described as a self-assured feeling of moral or social superiority.

Note: This expression became popular in recent television shows such as 'Lie to Me' and 'Criminal Minds'. Though it is a recognized human expression, our recent societal influences and shifts have made it a gesture that is now commonly seen in flirtatious and courting behaviour."
Ag,This facial expression forces the eyebrows down and compresses the lips together.
Pr,"
Protective gestures involve one or more of the limbs crossing over the body to cover a vital area or piece of property. This is associated very closely with anxiety, insecurity and uncertainty with a person or subject. It is, however, a closed gesture in that it allows limited access to the body."
Sw,"When associated with deception detection research, swallowing behaviour is inconclusive at best.

We do know that excess saliva is produced during Reticular Activation System activation and the spike in adrenaline that immediately follows. There is no way to determine whether a swallow is due to stress, anxiety deception, etc.

Exceptions to this, of course, would be excessively thirsty or dehydrated subjects, and subjects who swallow regularly (in the baseline)."
Ec,"This behaviour can only be observed in a seated subject. It involves the inward drawing of the elbows as they sit on the table. This drawing together instinct has its origins in the same place as protective gestures (Pr). It is designed to bring non-vital body parts in front of vital ones. This is especially common in deception with police interrogations studied in the United States.

This behaviour is also affected by temperature."
Ss,"he single-sided shoulder shrug is a gesture that is almost exclusively tied to doubt and disbelief.

The deception timeframe specifically states that this will be almost exclusively seen during a verbal expression vice any other time. Alone, of course, this is not enough to throw a flag yet, and other high-rated deceptive behaviours must accompany it.

Anytime a subject shrugs a single shoulder, it indicates disbelief in what the subject is saying or what is being discussed at the moment it occurs."
De,"This behaviour refers to the action of the extension of the fingers. It reflects a relatively low level of stress and anxiety and is not associated with deception. This can occur at any time and in any position, seated or standing.

The extension of fingers and opening of the hands signifies openness and relaxation. In some
cases, this behaviour is also used when fearful, as seen above with Gp (Genital Protection)."
Pe,"The exposure of palms and wrists are both in this behavioural cell. This behaviour is done anytime a subject desires to appear trustworthy, nonthreatening or honest. This is frequently seen when witnessing denials and excusals from teens and adolescents, but human beings do not grow out of this behaviour.

It is just as common to see this in a murder investigation as it is in a missing candy quest with children."
Cs,"This behaviour, wherein a subject strokes or rubs the chin is mostly contemplative and indicates curiosity, thought and internal processing. When associated with Co (Contempt), the behaviour indicates contemplative ownership or deviant thought about the subject's audience."
Pc,"The constriction of pupils is a relative measurement in the interview process. Regardless of their initial size, any decrease in pupil size will qualify to be registered as a Pc.

The pupils normally constrict to restrict the amount of light coming into the eye, but they also respond to emotional stimuli. Seeing or hearing something we have a serious aversion to will cause the pupils to constrict. Some subjects will experience much more drastic contractions than others, and there is no way to measure this or identify how a subject will respond before an interview begins.

It is especially difficult to note the size change in pupils in subjects with dark-coloured irises."
Eo,"This cell refers to three types of variable behaviours related to the outward motion of the elbows.
This is an opening gesture."
Ps,"Being so variable, the posture, like other behaviours, should only be recorded if a shift occurs within the interview and the behaviour is observable as such."
No,"This behaviour is simply the horizontal shaking of the head to indicate 'no' in 90% of our planet. However, its relevance here is that it can occur during a statement when the subject is affirming a statement or attempting to confirm something. While saying that something is true, their head shaking reveals the truth of what they are actually thinking."
Lf,"This behaviour is not indicative of stress or anxiety in itself without confirming microphysiological indicators and making a determination as to which gesture is being seen in the interview. Variable 2 is likely indicative of stress and anxiety and, if associated with other
high-scoring behaviours should be moved to 2.0.

1. Locked fingers loosely and restfully 'laced' together
2. Locked fingers with visible signs of capillary/muscular tension"
St,"As seen when a subject is seated and the palms of the hands are facing each other, the tips of the fingers will touch. The steepled finger gesture is a sign of internal confidence in a social setting or particular subject matter. The three variations of the steeple are listed below.

A person holding the steeple high is far less likely to listen and absorb than a subject holding the steeple close to the surface of a table or at the near-waist level."
Bh,"
This behaviour exhibits usually false confidence and is very closely associated with feelings of contempt and insecurity.

This is a deliberate dominance gesture intended to make the subject appear less concerned with the situation around him. The hands clasped behind the head also indicate the presence of a feeling of ownership over a group or person with whom the subject is socially engaged"
Ah,"Placing the arms on the hips is indicative of more than one meaning given contextual variations.

The thumbs going backwards can indicate a desire to appear 'in charge' in a male and a desire to present the body to a mate for a female. The context will play the largest role in determining meaning for this behaviour. The thumbs will also show a variation in meaning: The thumbs pointing forward indicate an emotional tendency toward curiosity and interest."
Shg,This differs from the Acc in that this involves both arms actively embracing the subject's body and the palms facing the body with thumbs NOT pointing upward. This is a closed and uncertain gesture used to self-soothe and gives the subject reassurance when stress or anxiety is high. This self-hugging behaviour is slightly more common in women.
Bb,"The placing of the arms behind the back indicates one of two basic categories of associated thoughts:

1. The subject holds hands behind back: Bb1 a. Indicates confidence and sometimes, superiority.

2. The subject holds a wrist or part of the arm with the opposing hand: Bb2 a. This is indicative of self-restraint in times of anger and the higher the grip on the
opposing arm, the higher the level of anger."
Cr,"This can happen for a few different reasons depending on contextual influences, but almost always will be a sign of social fear or self-consciousness. The raising of the shoulders is a vital-organ protection mechanism that occurs automatically when a subject experiences fear of any kind."
Wp,"Mostly performed by women, this behaviour is a self-conscious signal and involves the crossing of a single arm across the midsection of the body."
Fz,"When the cognitive system in a subject becomes loaded with scenario management and behaviour
regulation during deception, the movement of the body will sometimes come almost to a complete stop. The amount of mental energy exerted to manage their deception leaves little room for 'authentic gesture management'.

The exception here is Fr (Fear), wherein the Reticular
Activation System in the brain overrides movement in order to focus on more important things like threats to safety."
Ft,"Perhaps no other gesture has gained so much notoriety for being deceptive as the facial touch. Touching the face, as noted in over 90 behavioural studies, has shown to be the most common behaviour displayed in study subjects during deliberate deception.

As with all elements, the facial touch is no more important than others. In study settings, the gesture may only become more prevalent due to a lack of interviewer, decreased stress levels causing no leakage elsewhere on the body and the overall 'safety' of knowing that a study is being conducted, causing participants to relax more than if they were lying about a more important matter."
Ttc,"Clasping of the throat is almost identical to Ft (Facial Touching), with the small difference that this gesture is associated with fear and grave consequences."
Ia,The visible comfort displayed when the arms rise during a Sunday football touchdown is a great example of this behaviour. Comfortable subjects have no problem exposing underarms and moving their arms where they feel comfortable with fluidity.
Fig.4,"This seemingly Americana body movement is associated with comfort, relaxation and trust. The crossing of one ankle over the other knee is frequently seen around the world as the socio-gestural tolerance spreads in the world.

Due to the exposure of the sole of the foot, this is not acceptable in many countries throughout the Arab world and most of Asia. 90Kc is listed here as a conflicting gesture in that it can communicate apprehensiveness and a desire to end the conversation, whether in a figure four position or traditionally crossed."
Tlt,"This variable movement is visible almost immediately when observing a subject. It is often overlooked and can provide crucial information to the smart observer. This is primarily an observation that should be made while the subject is standing, but can be made in a seated position as well if it is visible.

The pelvis can tilt forward and backwards. The forward motion of the pelvis arches the lower back and pushes the groin to the rear. The backward motion of the pelvis brings the groin forward and rounds the lower back.

The forward rotated or positioned pelvis is seen in confident subjects and when they experience situational emotional confidence.

The backward rotated or positioned pelvis indicates a lack of confidence and the associated emotions."
Ff,"Even when the upper body isn't facing the direction where a subject is paying the most attention, when standing, the pelvis will often follow the subject's object of mental focus."
Po,"
Protective gestures involve one or more of the limbs crossing over the body to cover a vital area or piece of property. This is associated very closely with anxiety, insecurity and uncertainty with a person or subject. It is, however, a closed gesture in that it allows limited access to the body."
Tch,The touching of the chest is a behaviour commonly seen in movies by women when they receive bad information from a sheriff. This is an unsure and nervous gesture performed in response to stressful or anxiety-producing stimuli.
DC,"The double leg cross is quite different in meaning from a cross as a Figure 4 or a traditional cross at the knees.

The double cross is when the legs are crossed in the traditional over-the-knee manner and the foot crosses once more around the lowest leg. This is a very distinct gesture that indicates withholding and probable concealment."
Tp,"Tapping fingers on a table can have multiple meanings. It is contextually dependent and can indicate boredom, inner thought, nervousness, and tension release.
"
Fi,"While this gesture can be performed by subjects with or without an object, it typically involves the seemingly non-productive and is not intended to accomplish a specific task."
Grs,"This is the behaviour wherein a subject grasps an object with both hands. It can be a thigh, leg, object, clothing or any other object. This is a closed gesture, but can be displayed during anxiety and indicate a need for reassurance and control.

Women who are untrusting or overly cautious about their environment will do this to their purses (more on this in the Phoenix Seven people
reading system)."
Bon,"The hands will draw rearward to the back of the neck on occasions that present the subject with an opportunity for stress, anxiety or deep contemplative thinking."
Lp,This is a self-conscious behaviour that manifests itself in the form of picking lint (real or imaginary) from clothing or nearby objects.
Wf,"This behaviour is similar in all regards to the ventilation gestures, in that it communicates a pacifying of stress or a need to reduce internal conflict or anxiety."
Bar,"This behaviour is somewhat difficult to pin down in a social context. The arms will move in various directions throughout a conversation, but the barrier gesture is a behaviour that specifically involves an arm coming in a direct line between the interviewer and the subject.

This is a subtle and mostly unconscious gesture that occurs in sometimes fragmentally significant increments."
Bc,"This behaviour is somewhat difficult to pin down in a social context. The arms will move in various directions throughout a conversation, but the barrier gesture is a behaviour that specifically involves an arm coming in a direct line between the interviewer and the subject.

This is a subtle and mostly unconscious gesture that occurs in sometimes fragmentally significant increments."
Pdn,"This occurs for various reasons and indicates a lack of willingness to be transparent, honest and forthcoming in an interview. It is a lack of a subject's willingness to 'show their hand', so to speak."
Gpr,"This behaviour is unconscious and indicates the subject's immediate need to protect themselves when a verbal, physical or psychological threat is presented to them."
Hu,"Barbara and Allan Pease coined this behaviour term. When a subject brings their hand to their face and does any behaviour that covers the mouth, this is considered a hushing gesture for the BToE."
Ge,"Any time a subject opens the legs or parts them in the direction of the interviewer, it shows trust, vulnerability, honesty and a willingness to communicate the truth."
Lg,"This behaviour is seen when the legs cross in the traditional way; where one knee is crossed over the other and the legs remain mostly together. This is indicative of trust and comfort. Subjects will also typically cross their legs toward the people they trust in a social scene when first sitting down.

While this gesture is important to note while in an interview, its opposite is of even more value. The uncrossing of the legs indicates the opposite of the meaning above."
Agg,"This is an anti-gravity gesture that is frequently seen with Ai (Arms in Air) and is usually a relief, celebratory and exclamatory gesture. This indicates elatedness and happiness."
Bre,breathing rate changes
Fc,"While this sounds much like the previous behaviour of Twisting Torso, it is specifically referring to the direct frontal or away facing of the torso.

For instance, the torso is pointed slightly away from the interviewer at the beginning of a question group and the question causes the subject to immediately face his full body toward the interviewer while either answering or listening to the question.

Conversely, the complete opposite is the second variable of this, where the torso would be completely turned away from the interviewer."
Pt,"Within any social encounter, especially one involving only two parties, the tilt of the torsos
toward and away from one another is a constant and revealing behavior from both people about
their thoughts. Leaning towards another person shows an interest in that person. When two
people lean in towards each other, they are communicating mutual interest. When one leans in
and the other leans back, the person leaning back is showing their lack of interest, comfort,
higher status or trust."
Kh,"This is a rare occurrence in the interview, but this is where a subject, in a seated position, wraps both arms around legs that are pulled up to the chest. This has been hypothesized as being a stand-in person and that a subject will hug their legs when a person is unavailable to pacify anxiety or stress."
Df,The flexion (drawing in) of the fingers toward the palm is a fantastic in-the-moment barometer of the anxiety of the subject in that specific moment. Noticing a small movement of the fingers in an interview can produce a lot of information when paired with the associated verbal and emotional content within the interview question group.
Bi,"This occurs when the legs come together and show no relaxation. This behaviour also frequently brings the feet together to touch. This is associated with secretiveness, fear, anxiety, worry and mistrust."
La,"This occurs when the ankles are locked and usually under a chair. Subjects who are unwilling to provide a lot of information, or are withholding or concealing something will do this.

It is best to deliberately modify this behaviour by asking them to stand or move in a way that causes their ankles to unlock."
Gm,"Any behaviour conducted with the intention on improving physical appearance or visual presentation is a grooming behaviour.

These behaviours exhibit themselves in various forms and are relevant to a degree when connected to the stimulus that caused them.

Several variations of upbringing can increase or
decrease the frequency of these gestures. Noting this in your notebook (or mental notebook) should be an easy observation in conversation, regardless of the environment."
Thc,"While this is more prevalent in women, men can also display this. This auto-contact behaviour is commonly displayed during physical attraction and sexual arousal. Women will do this in a similar way to pacifying behaviour, in that the hands are taking the place of another person and instead of soothing them, they are caressing them."
Wt,"This is another form of auto-contact behaviour. It involves the touching of wrists. It is listed as a
closed gesture due to its barrier-creating properties and its meaning in a social context. This behaviour is used as a barrier and comforting movement; It gives subjects a sense of protection and security when experiencing social pressure, nervousness or anxiety.

This is often seen in men when in public in the form of reaching across and using one hand to adjust the wristwatch or shirt cuff of the other hand. Performing this same behaviour to pop knuckles, rub hands, adjust a sleeve or any other similar action is all considered.

The second variable here is when a subject reaches across and physically grasps the wrist of the opposite hand. This is anger-related and self-restraint behaviour that sends a completely different signal."
Ip,"This happens very slightly more in women than men and indicates self-consciousness and when paired with barrier behaviours, can indicate concealment, mistrust or withholding."
Er,This is another hand-to-face gesture that shows signs of concern in addition to the stress immediately identified by the hand-to-face gesture.
Kc,The knee clasp behaviour is indicative of a need to leave or end a conversation. This takes place only in the seated position.
Fw,"This is the sudden withdrawal of the feet during conversation while seated. The feet draw rearward underneath a chair. This behaviour indicates the sudden and immediate need for withholding and can also indicate loss of trust in the interviewer, self-consciousness and concealment."
Fns,"This is a variation of a hushing gesture with the added meaning of concealing the instinct to cover the mouth. This is a high-rated behaviour in that it is one of the most deceptive in all of the nonverbal deception research.

While this behaviour alone might not score high enough to be qualified as deceptive, when it is seen in interviews, it is almost always accompanied
by a similarly rated gesture."
Opi,"A subject's willingness to physically interact with property belonging to people who aren't familiar with them can indicate their comfort level and sometimes contempt for those around them. Typically, subjects will handle another person's property, in the same manner, they feel towards the person.

If they are careless with their property, the assumption can safely be made that they are not fond of them. For the BToE observations, we simply note the presence or
unwillingness to interact with such property."
Oi,"The way a subject interacts with objects in the room and furniture around them can be a highly accurate indicator of their comfort and confidence levels. A subject's willingness to touch objects and move chairs to suit their comfort level shows how willing they are to take charge of their environment and can be revealing.

A subject wishing to put on the best deception show of their lives will likely do everything possible not to disturb the environment. This in itself is not deceptive, because the guilty and innocent will always show different baselines of confidence and comfort."
Sr,"The willingness or display of the removal, partial removal or unconscious fidgeting with footwear shows signs of comfort, confidence and trust. This can occur in numerous ways and if seen, should be interpreted as a sign of subject comfort and trust.
"
BeC,"This behaviour refers to the subject's carelessness with his or her own property. Whether conscious or unconscious, a display of carelessness will communicate a careless attitude and an aloof nature that is not conducive to a good interview.

Examples of this are throwing phones, keys and objects onto the table, tossing purse onto seat, yanking chair out to sit and throwing jackets onto chair back."
Wc,This behaviour is commonly understood and easily spotted by a novice interviewer. Pay particular attention to whether the checking of the watch involves two hands and if the opposing hand places an unusual amount of tension while 'holding' the watch to view it.
Jb,"This is more common in males simply due to the type of clothing worn regularly by men. The buttoning of a jacket usually indicates a stopping point in trust, withholding and anxiety."
Cc,"This refers to the pulling or adjusting of clothing in a way that increases its amount of coverage on the body. This can be seen in women pulling a shirt down to cover themselves, lifting a sleeve to decrease breast exposure and pulling sleeves to cover more wrist area."
Ob,"This involves the covering of the body with any object. Girls walking to school holding books across their chest, holding a drink at a bar in front of the body, using a book or clipboard as a barrier on a table by lifting it and putting objects (even cups) in between the subject and interviewer are all examples of this behaviour."
Ca,"This involves the wrapping of the hands around the arms of a chair. This can be a sign of self-restraint and could indicate the withholding of information. Make note of the pressure with which the subject grasps the arms of the chair and if one hand is tighter, showing more capillary response than the other."
Gs,This is a barrier gesture but it differs from Ob (Object Barrier) in that the same behaviours are made to cover the genital areas.
Bs,"This occurs when a subject visually or physically interacts with an object belonging to them for the purpose of checking its safety, presence or exact location. This is a strong indicator of mistrust and shows signs of nervousness and insecurity. This is commonly seen in interviews when a female subject unconsciously grabs her purse or pulls it closer to her without looking.

Another common example of this is men reaching back to check for the presence of their wallets, pulling a phone on the table closer to them and patting a shirt pocket to ensure something is still there."
Ftb,This is a highly aggressive behaviour but is almost equally shown in deceptive and genuine people.
Oc,"This behaviour is seen when subjects conceal something from view or attempt to do so. When you approach a subject and they tilt the screen of their phone away, close the opening of a purse or unconsciously draw their hand over a phone screen.

This is also seen when holding a phone to
the side of the body. The angle of the phone is unconsciously adjusted away from the
interviewer."
Jp,"The jewellery most people wear is closely associated with identity and self-image. Playing or fiddling with jewellery can be a way subjects pacify themselves during social stress or anxiety.

This is frequently seen in women playing with or reaching up to grasp a necklace or bracelet."
Cl,"When a subject wraps the ankles around the legs of a chair as if to stay put when someone is
pulling them upward is marked as Cl. This behavior is a self-restraint gesture and almost always
indicates the withholding of information and unwillingness to openly participate in conversation.
This is an under-researched behavior, but has been seen more commonly in young adults during
interview scenarios."
Hes,"The hesitancy seen before the answer begins to come to an answer is usually a time gap that allows a subject to process their story in their mind and ensures its success before vocalizing and answering out loud.

This occurs in only one way, wherein the subject displays a distinct pause prior to answering a question or making a statement."
Psd,"This occurs when a subject euphemizes the crime or offence in question and replaces it with a less-severe word. Examples include using 'hurt' instead of 'kill', 'take' instead of 'steal', 'relations' instead of 'sex' and 'touch' instead of 'molest'.

This is a very common deception tactic employed by the subconscious to lessen the guilt experienced in the presence of interviewers. It is a psychological way of reducing the amount of nonverbal stress that shows in the body during interviews as well."
Rip,The stress of deceiving an interviewer and the anxiety caused by fear of failure with high stakes causes the muscles in the vocal production area to tighten and raise the natural pitch of the voice during testimony and conversation.
Spd,"This observation requires the interviewer or analyst to establish a vocal baseline, noting the cadence with which a subject speaks. In an attempt to quickly 'get it over with', subjects will frequently speed up the rate of speech in order to lessen the amount of psychological stress experienced and exude fewer nonverbal signs of deception during the deceptive statement."
NA,"This occurs when a subject replies to a question with a lengthy response that does not answer the question.

Any reply to a question that doesn't answer the question is considered a non-answer statement. For example, if an interviewer asks, ""Did you go to the liquor store last night?"" and the subject responds by saying, ""I don't even drink."""
Prn,"Deceptive statements will sometimes lack pronouns because of the load placed on the cognitive faculties during deception. An example of this is a subject, after being asked to recount events, saying the following: ""Well, woke up around two, went to the ATM at the gas station, left the bar around two AM and got back to the house around two thirty.""

You will see the absence of pronouns come up more regularly in conversation when you begin to listen more to regular daily conversations you have with others."
Res,"This verbal expression is commonly used as an answer to an allegation or a question involving the suspicion of wrongdoing. Subjects may express themselves to the interviewer by giving all the reasons that they aren't capable of the act, the volunteer work they do, where they went to school or their position within a community.

After being questioned about a theft, a subject may
reply, ""I am a well-respected member of this community and I volunteer at the church. My wife and I both give our time to help the homeless and our neighbours will tell you the same thing""

This statement hasn't answered the question, and the subject is attempting to manage the way the interviewer sees them by listing good qualities and civic involvement."
Nc,"When a subject denies or rejects an accusation, in order to make the statement easier to believe, they may remove the contraction of two words, such as 'did not' instead of 'didn't' and 'could not' instead of couldn't'.

This is a way the subject can feel like they are more clearly communicating to the interviewer and is done on a subconscious level. The subject's subconscious mind is doing its best to remove ambiguous communication here in order to make the statement sound more matter-of-fact."
Qr,"This is an aggressive reversal of questioning by the subject. When asked a question, the subject will respond with a question that implies guilt in the interviewer or is designed to question the motives of the interviewer for asking the question."
Am,This occurs when a subject answers a question and provides vague statements about the incident or their recount of the events therein.
Pol,"This behaviour specifically involved the shift in politeness level within the conversation. If a subject frequently answers questions with 'yeah', 'yep' and 'mmhm', then follows another question with a sudden 'yes sir' or 'no sir' this is a shift in the level of politeness from the subject's typical behaviour."
Oa,"When a subject continually apologizes for things that occur during the interview, like not being able to provide more information, having inadequate detail or not having what they think the interviewer is looking for, this is a subconscious apology for other things that needs to be uncovered. The sudden presence of an apology in conversation is very much a red flag, regardless of its associated reason."
Mc,"This takes place in the form of a confession that isn't the event for which they are being questioned. In the subject's mind, if they can confess to a few small things, they will appear to be more open and honest and the interviewer will eventually either forget to ask them the bigger questions or trust them.

The mini confessions take place during the interview and seem to be genuine, honest confessions of small and insignificant wrongdoing."
Exc,"Words that seem to answer the question, but deliberately exclude an unknown item are exclusions. It is a polite way of withholding information from an interviewer.

Examples include the following.
1. ""...as far as I know...""
2. ""...to the best of my knowledge...""
3. ""...basically...""
4. ""...probably...""
5. ""...I suppose..."""
Chr,"This behaviour is difficult to spot because the interviewer has the potential to inadvertently trigger
it and therefore make it void and unrecordable. When a subject recounts a story or chain of events in perfect chronological order, this is a Chr.

Emotional stories will often be jumbled and the subject will almost always start with the most traumatic part of the story.

However, if the interviewer directly asks the subject to recount events in the order they occurred, the chronology of their statement is basically irrelevant."
Acc,"The arm cross gesture is used universally and has 4 basic variations important to the interviewer. This gesture is frequently seen in magazines, detective shows and books. All of these sources say the same thing: ""Crossing your arms is defensive.""

While there is a hint at the truth in this 'translation', the actual meaning reveals much more. When making an observation of the performance of this behaviour, note the closeness of the palms to the body, the direction the thumbs are pointing, the tightness of the cross, the flexion of the fingers and the distance from the humerus (upper arm) to the torso.

These variations all broadcast small, but significant details about the gesture's true meaning. Crossing the arms is something we do when we need assurance, warmth or when we feel threatened.

Here are a few generalized rules to follow when making observations about arm-crossing behaviour:

• The tighter the grip, the stronger the need for reassurance.

• Palms go toward the body in such a way that we hug ourselves when needing reassurance.

• When thumbs protrude upward, this is an almost certain sign of confidence, despite the crossed arms.

• Digital flexion increases in synch with the level of anger experienced.

• Crossing arms, when grouped with posture and facial expression, can be a sure sign of pride.

• Hands wrapped around upper arms and the associated display of Ag or Co is an intimidation attempt.

• When women do this during socially stressful situations, it is almost always accompanied by Sh.

• When the fingers wrap around the arms and pull toward the sternum, look for Ag. This is a warning sign. If you see this with Wd, your subject is about to become violent.

• The dominant hand is almost always the one on top, while the dominant arm is on the bottom"
